# AI Debate Arena

A simple app to let LLMs debate on any topic and get for and against arguments. The topic could be a decision you want to make, philosophical questions, or literally anything you want to get two sides of the story about.

## How to use

1. Enter a topic you want the models to debate on
2. Choose your models and start
3. For and against models will auto fire off
4. You can add your own arguments to steer the debate or press the skip button to let the models continue
5. This loop continues
